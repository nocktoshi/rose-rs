## Cryptographic and Wallet Primitives for Nockchain

Iris provides a comprehensive set of Rust libraries for building lightweight wallets for the Nockchain network. It includes cryptographic primitives, data structures, and WASM bindings for web integration.

> [!NOTE]
> This library does not support V0 addresses.

## gRPC Support

The gRPC client requires a gRPC-web proxy, such as Envoy, connected to a public Nockchain gRPC server.

## Crates

The project is split into several crates:

| Crate | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| [iris-crypto](crates/iris-crypto) | Cryptographic primitives | Beta |
| [iris-grpc-proto](crates/iris-grpc-proto) | gRPC protobuf definitions | Beta |
| [iris-nockchain-types](crates/iris-nockchain-types) | Core Nockchain types | Beta |
| [iris-wasm](crates/iris-wasm) | WASM bindings for web | Beta |
| [iris-ztd](crates/iris-ztd) | Base Zero-knowledge data structures and noun-lib | Beta |
| [iris-ztd-derive](crates/iris-ztd-derive) | Derive macros for iris-ztd | Beta |

## no_std Support

Most crates in this workspace support `no_std` environments (with `alloc` required) to facilitate usage in WASM and embedded contexts.
